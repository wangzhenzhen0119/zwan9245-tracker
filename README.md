Content functional changes:
Original (UI): added + pop-up event that occurs by keystroke - when clicked, pop-up appears above and overrides quote: Nothing is worth living for without music. Content: input value + music tag

Now: + popup event generated by keystroke - when clicked, full screen popup appears, input value

Pain points: the overall construction of the elements, the beginning of the css settings all used px, fixed point position, which led to too much time spent on replacing the % later, and I set absolute in the Position, which led to many problems when I zoomed in and out through the page. Further adjustments would have taken me more time to try and modify. So I kept the modified adaptive settings and gave up on further adjustments.
